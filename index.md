# Rishu Mehra – Technical Writing Portfolio

## About Me

I’m a passionate technical writer with over 10 years of experience creating developer-focused documentation, API references, user manuals, and onboarding guides. My work encompasses enterprise platforms like **BrowserStack**, **Red Hat OpenShift**, and **Ivanti’s AI-powered ITSM** system. I specialize in constructing scalable, self-service documentation systems that alleviate support demands and expedite product adoption. In addition to traditional documentation, I also produce multimedia content—including videos, demos, and blog posts—to enhance learning and engagement across diverse user personas.
